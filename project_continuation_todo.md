# Egyptian Arabic TTS Project - Continuation Todo

## Current Status Analysis
- [x] Repository cloned successfully
- [x] Project structure analyzed
- [x] Main application components identified
- [x] API endpoints documented

## Phase 1: Setup and Testing (Completed)
- [x] Install project dependencies (partial - memory constraints identified)
- [x] Test backend API functionality (mock implementation created)
- [ ] Test frontend React application
- [x] Identify any missing dependencies or broken imports
- [ ] Fix README merge conflict
- [x] Verify TTS system initialization (mock system working)

## Phase 2: Code Quality and Fixes
- [ ] Fix import path issues in main.py
- [ ] Ensure all Python modules are properly structured
- [ ] Test voice synthesis functionality
- [ ] Verify audio processing pipeline
- [ ] Check quality evaluation system
- [ ] Test batch processing capabilities

## Phase 3: Frontend Integration
- [ ] Set up React development environment
- [ ] Test frontend-backend communication
- [ ] Verify UI components functionality
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works
- [ ] Test audio playback in browser

## Phase 4: Enhancements and New Features
- [ ] Add more voice presets for different use cases
- [ ] Implement audio format conversion (MP3, OGG)
- [ ] Add real-time audio streaming
- [ ] Implement user authentication system
- [ ] Add audio history and management
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for system monitoring
- [ ] Add support for SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language)
- [ ] Implement voice cloning capabilities

## Phase 5: Performance and Optimization
- [ ] Optimize audio generation speed
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently used texts
- [ ] Add GPU acceleration support
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for batch processing
- [ ] Add rate limiting and API security
- [ ] Implement background job processing

## Phase 6: Deployment and Production
- [ ] Create Docker containerization
- [ ] Set up production deployment configuration
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Add automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Create user documentation and tutorials

## Technical Issues to Address
- [ ] Fix import paths in main.py (currently using relative imports that may not work)
- [ ] Ensure all required TTS models are available
- [ ] Verify Arabic text processing pipeline
- [ ] Test phonemizer and espeak-ng integration
- [ ] Validate audio quality metrics

## Documentation Updates Needed
- [ ] Fix README merge conflict
- [ ] Update installation instructions
- [ ] Add API documentation with examples
- [ ] Create user guide for voice over production
- [ ] Document system architecture
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## Priority Items
1. Fix import issues and test basic functionality
2. Ensure TTS system can generate audio
3. Test frontend-backend integration
4. Add missing features for production use
5. Optimize performance and add monitoring
