1. **Enhanced Flask API Server** (`main_enhanced.py`)
   - Running on port 5001
   - Full REST API with 8 endpoints
   - Real-time voice generation
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Quality evaluation system

2. **Enhanced Voice Synthesizer** (`enhanced_voice_synthesizer.py`)
   - espeak-ng integration for real TTS
   - Arabic text preprocessing
   - Multiple voice presets
   - Audio post-processing
   - Fallback to mock audio when needed

3. **Mock Implementations** (for testing)
   - Mock voice synthesizer
   - Mock audio processor
   - Mock TTS evaluator

4. **Frontend Ready** (React components exist)
   - App.jsx with user interface
   - Vite configuration
   - Ready for development

## API Endpoints Available

### Core Functionality
- `GET /api/health` - System health check
- `POST /api/generate` - Generate voice over from Arabic text
- `GET /api/audio/<id>` - Download generated audio files

### Configuration
- `GET /api/presets` - Available voice presets
- `GET /api/speakers` - Available speaker voices
- `GET /api/system-info` - System capabilities

### Advanced Features
- `POST /api/evaluate` - Evaluate audio quality
- `POST /api/batch-generate` - Batch voice generation

## Voice Presets Available

2. **Commercial Warm** - Warm and friendly commercial voice
3. **Educational Clear** - Clear and measured educational delivery
4. **Documentary Authoritative** - Authoritative documentary narration
5. **Audiobook Natural** - Natural storytelling voice
6. **News Professional** - Professional news delivery

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Dependency Resolution
- **Problem**: Original requirements.txt had memory-intensive packages that couldn't install
- **Solution**: Created lightweight dependency set with essential packages only
- **Result**: Working installation with core functionality

### 2. TTS Implementation
- **Problem**: Original code had broken imports and no actual TTS implementation
- **Solution**: Created enhanced voice synthesizer with espeak-ng integration
- **Result**: Real Arabic text-to-speech generation working

### 3. Arabic Language Support
- **Problem**: No proper Arabic text processing
- **Solution**: Integrated arabic-reshaper and python-bidi for proper text handling
- **Result**: Correct Arabic text rendering and processing

### 4. Code Structure
- **Problem**: Import paths didn't match actual file structure
- **Solution**: Created new implementations with correct structure
- **Result**: Clean, working codebase with proper organization

## How to Use the Enhanced System

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd text_to_voice
python main_enhanced.py
```

### 2. Test the API
The server is currently running and exposed at:
`https://5001-i4bjzbrfzdbf1lnmbrew1-e38eca77.manusvm.computer`

### 3. Generate Voice Over
```bash
curl -X POST https://5001-i4bjzbrfzdbf1lnmbrew1-e38eca77.manusvm.computer/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "مرحبا بكم في نظام تحويل النص إلى كلام المصري",
    "speaker_id": "default",
    "voice_preset": "commercial-warm"
  }'
```

### 4. Download Audio
Use the audio_url from the generation response to download the WAV file.

## Next Steps for Further Development

### Immediate (1-2 weeks)
1. **Frontend Integration**: Set up React development environment and test UI
2. **Model Training**: Train custom Egyptian Arabic TTS models
3. **Performance Optimization**: Improve generation speed and quality

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
1. **User Authentication**: Add user accounts and session management
2. **Database Integration**: Store user data and audio history
3. **Advanced Features**: Voice cloning, SSML support, real-time streaming

### Long Term (3-6 months)
