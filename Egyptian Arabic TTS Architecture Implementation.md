# Egyptian Arabic TTS Architecture Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of a sophisticated text-to-speech system specifically designed for Egyptian Arabic voice over production.

## Architecture Overview

The system is built on the XTTS v2 architecture with Egyptian Arabic-specific adaptations:

1. **Text Processing Pipeline**: Handles Egyptian Arabic text normalization, diacritization, and phonetic conversion
2. **Neural TTS Model**: Based on XTTS v2 with Egyptian Arabic fine-tuning
3. **Voice Cloning Module**: Enables consistent voice characteristics for voice over work
4. **Audio Post-Processing**: Professional-grade audio enhancement for voice over quality
5. **API Interface**: RESTful API for integration with voice over production workflows

## Components

- `models/`: Neural network models and checkpoints
- `preprocessing/`: Text and audio preprocessing modules
- `training/`: Training scripts and configuration
- `inference/`: Voice synthesis and generation
- `api/`: REST API for production use
- `evaluation/`: Quality assessment and testing tools
- `data/`: Sample data and configuration files

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.12+
- TTS library (Coqui)
- Additional dependencies in requirements.txt

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Download pre-trained models: `python scripts/download_models.py`
3. Run inference: `python inference/synthesize.py --text "مرحبا بكم" --output output.wav`
4. Start API server: `python api/server.py`

## Voice Over Quality Standards

The system generates audio at professional voice over standards:
- Sample Rate: 48kHz
- Bit Depth: 24-bit
- Format: WAV (uncompressed)
- Dynamic Range: Optimized for voice over work
- Noise Floor: < -50dB
